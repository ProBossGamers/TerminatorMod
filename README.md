TerminatorMod


Programmer: N/A
Modelers: LadyHaley
Textures: LadyHaley


This mod aims to add Terminators into minecraft.
It a work in progress at the moment, with no programmers it is in a bit of a dead spot.

As of 21/9/18 I am planning on using MC Creator to create a rather janky first version as a proof of concept so that it can grasp the attention of someone more talantend than I am when it comes to java programming.

This first alpha version will contain a Plasma Rifle, A T-800 Model Terminator with its skin, a T-800 Model Without Skin, and a T-1 Model Terminator.

In time I will add some resistance fighters, more terminator models, some structures to spawn in and explore, a custom world gen for the skynet controlled future, a way to create your own skynet machine to produce terminators that will fight and expand on your behalf, an option to have skynet turn hostile agaisnt you, a way to hack hostile terminators, to turn the friendly, disable, or destory them, and maybe some tanks or aircraft.

If anyone wants to help out then let me know, the more help the better.
